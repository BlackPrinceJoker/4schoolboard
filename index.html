	<p>I am running for School Board because District 5 needs a voice and a vote for what is good and true and not what furthers the totalitarian agenda. However, goodness and truth are ideas that necessitate an authoritative standard of morality that is not based on the arbitrary will of men. We find this standard in the Word of God, and by this standard we ought to judge right and wrong.<br> <br> 
		<span class="title" style="color:red">Yard Signs:</span> I am trying to get yard signs out, so if you, or someone you know, has property in District 5 and would like a sign, please contact me at: <a href = "mailto: JoshLuther4SchoolBoard@gmail.com" style="color: #347B98">JoshLuther4SchoolBoard@gmail.com</a>
		<br><br> District 5 is all of Escambia that is north of both 9 Mile Rd and Interstate 10.

	<p>
		<br><br><span class="title">Who I am</span>
		<br>I am a follower of Jesus Christ and am active in a Reformed Baptist church locally. I believe that God’s Word applies to all of life, all the time, and not just when it’s convenient. I’ve lived in Escambia County for the past nine years and have a strong desire and commitment for liberty (freedom to love God and neighbor) to reign in our county. I am running for School Board because none of the other candidates seemed ready to acknowledge Christ as Lord and seek His blessing in the position of School Board member.
		<br><br><span class="title">My Qualifications</span>
		<br>I do not have any fancy degrees or letters to tack onto the end of my name. As far as life experience goes, for the past twenty years, I’ve been blessed to be raised by godly parents who’ve taught me to fear the Lord, follow His Word above all else, and seek to glorify Him in all my labors. I’m young and still have things to learn, but I am running for this office because I believe that “better is a little, with righteousness, Than great revenues with injustice.” (Pr 16:8) We don’t need to drive over the cliff a little slower, we need to break apart the chains of dependency and servitude to the state.
		<br><br><span class="title">Why Should People Who Don’t Have Kids Care About the School Board?</span>
		<br>  We should all be concerned about the public schools because our money is being taken to fund this anti-religious institution. The graduates of this education by and large have no fear of God, little respect for family, and believe that the government is the solution for everything. If they want something and you have the means of providing for it, they are happy to use the government to make you “charitable”.
		<br><br><span class="title">A Better Option</span>
		<br>  I am ultimately for replacing public schools with pluralistic education options that are managed by the family and private sector. I would rather we have productive, generous people in charge of diverse education institutions, instead of what we have today, namely, a small number of people funding their centralized education by forced taxation. I want to see an America where worldviews are perpetrated by charity and success, rather than by leaching money from productive people to raise more leaches. God gave us two hands and one mouth, so we need to be producing more than we consume. If we, as a rule, need to reach into our neighbor’s pocket to pay for our necessities, then we are broken people.
		<br><br><span class="title">Reformation Takes Time</span>
		<br>  I understand that public schools cannot simply be ripped out from under society, but we do need to make progress towards a more effective and ethical education network. And, that progress needs to start with halting the public school cancerous takeover of society.
		<br><br><span class="title">We Need Damage Control, not Expansion</span> 
		<br>  We need reductions in our public school system, not expansions. The problem with the public school isn’t that it needs to do more, but rather that it is trying to do things that it shouldn’t be working to do.
		<br><br><span class="title">Public Schools Work to Compete with Private Schools</span>
		<br>  Having sat through school board meetings, I’ve realized that many of the board members are under the delusion that public schools should compete with private schools. This is absurd. Public schools are funded by “legal plunder” (to borrow a term from Bastiat), which means that when the private schools get better then the public schools must either make everyone work harder or, more likely, raise taxes. In other words, the better private schools are, the more we will be taxed.
		<br><br>The only reason we would want people to choose public schools over private schools is if we wanted children to get a certain flavor of indoctrination from the public schools. And to clarify, I’m not saying that public schools should try to be bad, but rather that they should strive to be good at being basic. 
		<br><br><span class="title"> Public Schools Work to Destroy Christian Culture</span>
		<br>  While the Bible teaches us that God created all things and made man in his image, our public schools teach that highly compressed matter (of dubious origins) exploded into the universe and that man evolved from fish.
		<br><br>Now, while this new explanation of man’s origins provides a reason for kids to be in schools, it does not provide any moral framework, especially not a Christian framework. For the average person, this is very tragic, but for those in power, it creates a convenient vacuum in which they can write up their own morality in the form of legislation. 
		<br><br><span class="title"> Public Schools Work to Destroy the Institution of Marriage</span>
		<br>  God has blessed man with the institution of marriage, which are own constitution defines as: “the legal union of only one man and one woman as husband and wife…” (Florida Constitution, Article I, Section 27)
		<br><br>This institution (when honored by society) provides women with security and men with purpose. It provides for the woman a position in which the loyalty of her husband is secured, and it ties the man’s drive to the pursuit of securing a better world for his family, in which pursuit he can achieve true honor.
		<br><br>But instead of teaching boys and girls to pursue the opposite sex in marriage alone, the public school undermines the institution by teaching thirteen-year-olds how to fornicate without conceiving a baby or getting sexually transmitted diseases. 
		<br><br><span class="title"> Public Schools Work to Close the “Achievement Gap”</span>
		<br> Public Schools need to focus on effectively teaching the basics, rather than on equal outcomes. God has created each of us with different intellectual levels, and we are fools to work for uniform test scores (and we might also be fools for believing that test scores are an accurate evaluation of a child’s practical comprehension of the subject).
		<br><br>Additionally, the erosion of religion and family in a child's life contributes to his lack of effort put into his studies. A hedonistic and postmodern worldview falls woefully short of giving children the interest and drive to discover God’s world and subdue it for His glory. Because of these and other outside factors, the public schools shouldn’t be hyper-focused on the results, but should rather be committed to giving each child the opportunity to learn the essentials. The school is only responsible for the teaching; whether the student makes the effort to learn is between him and his parents. 
		<br><br><span class="title">Public Schools Work to Provide Socialistic Programs at the Taxpayers' Expense</span>
		<br>  While I understand that children, especially young boys, need to be more physically active than they are currently allowed in public schools, I also understand that you don’t need an elaborate sports program to meet this need. As experience in Africa has shown me, all you need for a game of soccer, for instance, is a field, a ball, and ten pairs of flip-flops. I’m not against sports programs in general, but I am very much against the coercive funding of those programs.
		<br><br><span class="title"> No Reformation without Repentance</span>
		<br>  We would be fools to assume that we can turn this mess around without being broken before God for our sins. They are an abomination to Him, and so they separate us from Him. Each of us personally has rebelled against the authority of God’s Word and has pursued our own lusts and passions. We as a society have blasphemed God in our disregard for preborn human life, the sanctity of marriage, and the proper role of government. But because Christ, on the cross, suffered God’s wrath for our sins, we can be reconciled to God personally and nationally when we confess our sins and turn to follow Christ as King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

<p>“If ye love wealth better than liberty, the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom, go home from us in peace. We ask not your counsels or arms. Crouch down and lick the hands which feed you. May your chains rest lightly upon you, and may posterity forget that ye were our countrymen.”
